Hi I'm Benjamin! I'm a current student at Viewpoint School and I'll be attending
Stanford University this fall! I love reading, photography, science, and writing code.
My favorite musical artists include Of Monsters and Men, Jose Gonzalez, and many more.
My favorite book series is probably _The Stormlight Archive_, by Brandon Sanderson,
but right now I'm reading _Red Rising_ by Pierce Brown.

I've been programming for around 5 years now. Most of my experience has been in the
systems area, and I have around 3 years of experience writing Rust, C, and C++. I also
have 5 years of Python experience working on other projects.
