Hi I'm Benjamin! I'm a current student at Viewpoint School and I'll be attending
Stanford University this fall! I love reading, photography, science, and writing code.
My favorite musical artists include Of Monsters and Men, Jose Gonzalez, and many more.
My favorite book series is probably _The Stormlight Archive_, but right now I'm reading
_Red Rising_.
