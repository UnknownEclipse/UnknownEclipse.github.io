Chernobyl is an event that lives in the hearts of every person on this planet. The HBO
miniseries of the same name is a fantastic dramatization of the events. What's more,
it focuses almost entirely on the human side of the disaster.

The main characters, Legasov and Scherbina, are fantastic representations of the two
sides of the disaster; the division between state and scientists. Legasov is forced
to fight tooth and nail just for the state to acknowledge that something must be wrong.

In every conflict, the sides are always clear at times, and frighteningly vague at others.
The unknown, the mystery, and the dread represented in every second of the show is perfect
at emphasizing just how little is known, as well as further showing the detachment between
party leadership and those doing their best to protect their friends, family, and the rest
of the world.
