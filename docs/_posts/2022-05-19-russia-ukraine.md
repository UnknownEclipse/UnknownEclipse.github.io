The recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a perfect example of the effects of
tribalism in the modern world.

As a result of the efforts of Russian media, the story inside of Russia and outside
is entirely different. The Russian media repeatedly claims that the war is in fact
a "special military operation" (despite being anything but), and that they are winning,
their losses are not as high as western sources might say, and that Russia is the 'Good
Guy'.

Of course, in nearly every other country the story is very different; Russia invaded
Ukraine as a means of preventing NATO from expanding, and are suffering severe losses
due to their incompetence.

The two sides here are even more obviously delineated than in fiction, and it shows the
extreme effects polarization can have.
