## Abstract

This research paper addresses the issues of tribalism in literature and the modern day.
Many different pieces of media are examined, from the HBO limited series 'Chernobyl'
to Sanderson's _The Stormlight Archive_. The parallels between fiction and the real world
are significant, and understanding the fiction can help examine the world in a different
light.
